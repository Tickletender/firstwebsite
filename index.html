   <h1>History of UFC</h1>
      <p>The UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) is the leading mixed-martial-arts promotion in the world. It did not start that way. In 1993 the UFC held it's first event in an open-weight tournement.</p>
      <p>Fighters back then knew only one martial art and fought to prove which fighting style was better. Jiu-jitsu dominated the early days of MMA</p>
      <p>The UFC though, while entertaining, struggled to get traction.  People at the time did not view this as sport, and the UFC had some steep compitition with the likes of PRIDE FC.</p>
   <h2>Rise of the UFC</h2>
  <p>MMA started to evolve, as fighters started to fight for themselves and learn different styles to make themselves better. The UFC continued to struggle financially. They were soon to go bankrupt. That was until they came up with the idea of TUF (The Ultimate Fighter) a show were different fighters competed in a tournement for a six-figure contract. The finale is what saved the UFC. It was Stephen Bonner vs Forrest Griffen.</p>
   <h3>UFC now</h3>
   <p>Now UFC reigns supreme in the MMA world. They have the best fighters and best marketing. The sport of MMA has changed for the better and the UFC looks like it'll be around for a long time.</p>
